libdlpp-0.1
===========

About the library
-----------------

Libdlpp is a thin wrapper for POSIX libdl (dlopen, dlsym, dlclose, dlerror, 
linked with -ldl). GNU dlvsym is also supported.


Usage
-----

Link with -ldl. A simple usage example is illustrated below. 


#include <dlpp.hh>
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
    try {
        Dl dl("libuseless.so");
        std::cout << *dl.symbol<int>("variable") << std::endl;
        std::cout << dl.symbol<int(std::string, int)>("function")("a", 1) << std::endl;
    }
    catch (std::runtime_error e) {
        std::cerr << "Could not open library file" << std::endl;
    }
}

The aforementioned authors deem that the program source code is simple enough
so as not to be considered a work of art and thus it's not eligible for copyright.
Use the library wrapper as you seem fit, however, no warranty of any kind is
given. License requirements inherited from POSIX libdl probably also set some
limits for redistributing a program compiled against this library.
